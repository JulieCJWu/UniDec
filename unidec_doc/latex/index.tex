Uni\+Dec is a Bayesian deconvolution program for deconvolution of mass spectra and ion mobility-\/mass spectra.

It was orignally published in\+: \href{http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.analchem.5b00140}{\tt M. T. Marty, A. J. Baldwin, E. G. Marklund, G. K. A. Hochberg, J. L. P. Benesch, C. V. Robinson, Anal. Chem. 2015, 87, 4370-\/4376.}

\subsection*{Uni\+Dec Documentation}

This documentation is for the Python engine and G\+U\+I.

My goal is that this documentation will allow you to utilize the power of the Uni\+Dec python engine for scripting data analysis routines and performing custom analysis. Also, it will allow you to add new modules to the Uni\+Dec G\+U\+I.

I\textquotesingle{}m still working on documenting some of the windows and extensions, but the core features should be here.

The C code is proprietary and not open source. The copyright is owned by the University of Oxford. If you are interested in the C source code, please contact me. It should be possible to share with appropriate licensing or research agreements.

\subsection*{Uni\+Dec Architecture}

Uni\+Dec is bilingual. The core of the algorithm is written in C and compiled as a binary. It can be run independently as a command line program fed by a configuration file.

The Python engine and G\+U\+I serve as a very extensive wrapper for the C core.

The engine (unidec.\+py) can be operated by independently of the G\+U\+I. This allows scripting of Uni\+Dec analysis for more complex and high-\/throughput analysis than is possible with the G\+U\+I. The engine contains three major subclasses, a config, data, and peaks object.

The G\+U\+I is organized with a Model-\/\+Presenter-\/\+View architecture. The main App is the presenter (G\+Uni\+Dec.\+py). The presenter contains a model (the Uni\+Dec engine at unidec.\+py) and a view (mainwindow.\+py). The presenter coordinates transfer between the G\+U\+I and the engine.

\subsection*{Getting Started}

Here is some sample code for how to use the engine. \begin{DoxyVerb}import unidec

file_name="test.txt"
folder="C:\\data"

eng=unidec.UniDec()

eng.open_file(file_name, folder)

eng.process_data()
eng.run_unidec(silent=True)
eng.pick_peaks()
\end{DoxyVerb}


In reading the documentation, it is perhaps best to start with the unidec.\+Uni\+Dec class. The main G\+U\+I class is G\+Uni\+Dec.\+Uni\+Dec\+App.
